== Description ==

The Skinnytip Tooltip Generator is a Wordpress plugin that allows easy creation of JavaScript pop-up tooltips
while creating content. The plugin is visible on the admin write post and write page areas. After inputting 
the content and an optional title of the tooltip, the plugin will automatically generate the neccessary
JavaScript code to attach the tooltip to a link or image.

The user can optionally open up the advanced options and change the width, padding, border, and colors of
the tooltip.

Tooltips can be previewed by hovering the cursor over the "preview this tooltip" link.

When the tooltip is satisfactory, copy and paste the tooltip code into the HTML view of the post or page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `skinnytip` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
